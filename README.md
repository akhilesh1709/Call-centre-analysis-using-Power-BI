# Call Centre analysis using Microsoft PowerBI
A churn analysis of calls in a call centre is performed. A detailed analysis of the calls received based on the duration, response time, location, setiment and channel is performed and visualised.

For this project, I used the following datasets:
1. Call Center_Call Center.csv

#### *Name of the powerBI file:*  Call centre.pbix
